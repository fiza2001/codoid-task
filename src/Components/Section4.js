          The road circling the Scottish Highlands has always existed, the
          single-tracks and winding lanes long providing a lifeline to farmers,
          fishermen and villagers along the coast. However, for years, it was
          without a name - and anyone who has dreamed of driving a cadillac
          along Route 66 knows just how important that can be. If youâ€™re looking
          for a great British adventure this summer, add the North Coast 500 to
          your list.
